Holistic Psychology Booking Platform
1. Product Overview

The Holistic Psychology Booking Platform is a privacy-first, SEO-optimized online booking system for holistic psychologists. It enables practitioners to manage availability and bookings securely, while allowing clients to book sessions without creating accounts.

The system is designed to be HIPAA-aware, self-hosted, and scalable, using Cloudflare’s edge stack for performance and future growth.

2. Problem Statement

Current booking tools for holistic psychology practices:

Are difficult to use for vulnerable populations

Do not prioritize privacy or HIPAA considerations

Lack SEO optimization, reducing discoverability

Require heavy SaaS lock-in with limited data ownership

This platform solves those issues with a lightweight, transparent, and practitioner-owned solution.

3. Target Users
Primary Users

Holistic psychologists

Small psychology practices

Secondary Users

Families

Survivors of domestic violence

Single mothers

Low-income individuals seeking therapy

4. Product Goals

Enable account-free client bookings

Ensure secure practitioner-only access

Maintain HIPAA-aware data handling

Optimize for SEO and accessibility

Deploy using edge-native infrastructure

Be extensible for future features (payments, insurance, multi-practitioner)

6. Development Methodology (Chaining Prompt Rule)

Every task must follow this pattern:

State Now – What exists currently?

Change State – What command or code changes it?

Verify State – How do we confirm success?

This rule applies to:

Git

Database migrations

API routes

UI components

Deployments
