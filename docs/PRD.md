# Holistic Psychology Booking Platform 
# PRD.md Holistic Psychology Booking Platform

1. Product Overview

The Holistic Psychology Booking Platform is a privacy-first, SEO-optimized online booking system for holistic psychologists. It enables practitioners to manage availability and bookings securely while allowing clients to book sessions without creating accounts.

The platform is built on a Cloudflare edge-native stack to ensure performance, scalability, and future extensibility.

2. Core Principles

HIPAA-aware by design (data minimization, auditability)

Practitioner-owned data

Account-free client booking

SEO-first public pages

Incremental, testable development

Junior-developer friendly execution

3. Target Users
Practitioners

Holistic psychologists

Small private practices

Clients

Families

Survivors of domestic violence

Single mothers

4. Out of Scope (MVP Guardrails)

The MVP explicitly excludes:

Video therapy

Insurance billing

Mobile apps

Client user accounts

Payments

These are planned future epics, not MVP blockers.

6. Required Reading (Before Coding)

📄 Setup.md

Repository creation

Cloudflare setup

D1 database creation

Wrangler configuration

Local + production workflows

👉 This PRD assumes Setup.md has been completed successfully.

7. Development Rule: Chaining Prompt Standard

Every task must follow this execution pattern:

State Now – What exists?

Change State – What code or command changes it?

Verify State – How do we confirm success?

❌ Never jump directly to deployment
✅ Always validate locally first
